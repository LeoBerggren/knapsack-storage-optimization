# knapsack-storage-optimization-
Applying the knapsack and GAP problem to research data storage optimization, with data from KI

A combination of different algorithms are tried and compared when tackling the 0/1 Knapsack Problem  with unique items as well as the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). These are for the Knapsack Problem: dynamic programming; dynamic programming reformulated as to use values instead of weights for the memory matrix; Greedy approach; Genetic approach and lastly Branch and Bound. 

For the GAP we implement only a Genetic approach as well a Branch and Bound.
